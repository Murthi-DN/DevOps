What is Kafka?

* Apache Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system and a robust queue that can handle a high volume of data and enables you to pass messages from one end-point to another

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Architecture:

* Topics:
	A stream of messages belonging to a particular category is called a topic.

* Partition
	Topics may have many partitions, so it can handle an arbitrary amount of data.

* Offset

	Each partitioned message has a unique sequence id called as offset.

* Brokers

	Brokers are simple system responsible for maintaining the pub-lished data.

* Kafka Cluster

	Kafkaâ€™s having more than one broker are called as Kafka cluster.

* Producers
	
	Producers are the publisher of messages to one or more Kafka topics.

* Consumers

	Consumers read data from brokers

* Leader

	Leader is the node responsible for all reads and writes for the given partition. Every partition has one server acting as a leader.

* Follower

	Node which follows leader instructions are called as follower. If the leader fails, one of the follower will automatically become the new leader

* Replicas of partition

	Replicas are nothing but backups of a partition. Replicas are never read or write data. They are used to prevent data loss.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Kafka broker has multiple server, one is leader, others are followers
* Here, Each nodes have Partitions and Replicas

So when producer sends message -> Topics -> Kafka Brokers (Partions|Replicas) -> Consumers
